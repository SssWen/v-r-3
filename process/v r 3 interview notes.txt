=== v r 

v r as an overall series about the virtual and the real (but not VR)

=== Sitting beside the water in Wellington

	Actually saw real caustics in the water
	Dependence of the appearance of water on what's in/under it
	Temporal qualities of water over time
	Unreal look of real water (reality of virtual water)
	Do we ever actually look at water? Tech water as bare minimum trick?
	
=== Genesis story

student showing my Unity Pro Water in his project, "Pro"
	Water as beautiful to look at
	Water as technology, water as a professional achievement, artisinal water,
	-> What about just the act of looking at water, then?
	
=== Third party water

	Artisans
	Spent roughly CAD$250 (Â£140)
	Water with different aesthetic (and functional) goals
	
Magic Water, Cartoon Water, Best Water, Decent Water (Robert Yang), Fake Water, Water Flow Free versus Water Flow ($3), Hard Water, Easy Water ($20!), Mobile Water, Realistic Water (ha ha, $35!! Would have needed a special plinth?)
	
===> Water with purpose

	Realistic
	Realism + functionality
	Cartoony
	Low poly
	High performance
	Reflective/refractive
	In motion
	
=== Physical versus digital

	Pros: no leaks, no seepage, nothing gets wet, doesn't evaporate, no health and safety issues, no touching!...
	Cons: misbehaviour of other kinds, SCALE issues, 5 foot high waves, flat water, no reflections, wrong colour, shape shifting, ... "wants to be a lake"

	The need to understand water at the level of code/tech in order to get to to behave 'properly' in simulated space
	(Exhibiting the bugs?)
	Frame-rate drops with lots of water (occlusion culling doesn't happen)
		Water stops time!

	Posture in digital museums
	Sound! (None of it comes with sound?! Ha ha, "comes with sound")
	
	Had to edit the underlying code around the shader to get multiple versions of water to display in Unity
	
=== What is good?
	
What is the 'natural state' of digital water?
How much am I supposed to make the water 'look right' versus simply exhibit it the 'way it is' when you get it?

The clearness of water - is clear water better than blue water?
